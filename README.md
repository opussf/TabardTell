Tabard Tell
=====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opussf/TabardTell.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opussf/TabardTell)

This addon shows the faction's reputation in the tooltip for the respective tabard.

## Idea:
I got tired of looking in the reputation frame to figure out which tabard I wanted to wear.
And it just sort of made sense.

## Goals:
* Simple to use addon
* No configuration

## How to use:
Install the addon, mouse over a tabard in your inventory.
